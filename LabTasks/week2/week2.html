  <h1> Week 2: Notated Music </h1>
  <p> For this week's taks, I have decided to transcribe The Black Keys' song Little Black Submarines. 
  This specific arrangement was written by Anna Poole and can be accessed on MuseScore
  <a href="https://musescore.com/user/9532736/scores/5661552"> here </a>.
  Originally, the arrangement is for a piano and a clarinet, 
  but I have transcribed it to be for a piano and voice by transposing the clarined diatonically down by a second.
