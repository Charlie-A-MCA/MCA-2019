The theme of my dataset is the American blues rock band The Black Keys. The band consists of two members, a guitarist and lead vocalist Dan Auerbach and a drummer Patric Carney. The duo formed the bend in Akron, Ohio in 2001 and has since released nine albums for which it won numerous awards, including five Grammys. To this day, they have five number one hits to their name, including Tighten Up, Gold on the Ceiling and Lonely Boy. Their latest album, Letâ€™s Rock, was released mid 2019 after a five year break.
